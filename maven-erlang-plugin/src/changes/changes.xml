    <release version="2.0.0" date="TBA" description="New feature release">
      <action dev="olle-t" type="add">
        Added plain text coverage report as optional output direct to stdout
        instead of saved coverage report.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="remove">
        Removed support for SNMP resource compilation.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="add">
        Added support for test resources which will override main resources.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="add">
        Added support for test and provided scope dependencies.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="add">
        Fixed run goal to start all transitive application dependencies and
        pre-load all project (and dependency) modules.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="add">
        Added more checks for release file management support, removed automatic
        release file generation.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="add">
        Added more checks for application file management support, removed
        automatic application file generation.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="add">
        Added several unit and integration tests.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert, olle-t" type="add">
        All mojos now use jinterface for erlang rpcs instead of using
        erl -run or erl -eval. First of all this speeds up the build
        significantly. Another big advantage is that the plugin can now be
        integrated into the development using emacs with the distel extension
        since the plugin can use the emacs distel node or vice versa.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="add">
        Added packaging type erlang-std which respects the default erlang/OTP
        application directory layout.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="add">
        Test suffixes can now be either "_test" (for backward compatibility) or
        "_tests" eunit standard.
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="1.0.0-beta" date="2010-12-17" description="Initial release">
      <action dev="olle-t" type="update">
        Changed the use of the "test" property, a single specified test 
        (-Dtest=some_test) is always considered to have a .beam suffix, but
        never assumes anything else about the test module name. 
      </action>
      <action dev="olle-t" type="add">
        New mojo that copies test-resources, bound to the 
        generate-test-resources phase. 
      </action>
      <action dev="heyll" type="fix">
        'TEST' was not set while compiling sources in testphase for coverage.
        Added setting of 'TEST' macro to the cover2:compile call.
      </action>
      <action dev="olle-t" type="add">
        New parameter for the run goal, allowing optional command line 
        parameters to be passed to the starting Erlang node.
      </action>
      <action dev="olle-t" type="add">
        Parameter in the package goal, controlling if the temporary directory is
        deleted or not.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert, heyll" type="add">
        Added mock system (formerly known as ltest_mock, formerly known as
        erlymock). The system is automatically available for test modules during
        the test phase.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert, heyll" type="fix">
        Fixed various problems in test/compile phase when using include files
        from dependency applications.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="update">
        Changed dialyzer to run on sources not beams.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="add">
        New (fixed) surefire report generation handling each test module as
        separate test suite. Therefore an alternative surefire module is
        provided by the plugin.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="add">
        Added run goal for packaging erlang-otp to compile/test and run an
        erlang/OTP application for easy testing.

        with annotated source code listings.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="fix">
        Fixed cover compilation with the export_all option to provide coverage
        reports for non-exported module functions. Therefore an alternative,
        patched cover module is provided by the plugin.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="add">
        Added support for the maven-release-plugin by using application and
